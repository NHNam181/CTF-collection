<br />This is a basic disk forensic. You are given a disk file. You can install the disk on any hypervisor you like, in this case I use Virtual Box. Before getting to the disk image installation step, I used Linux Reader to check if there are any lost files and it is more convenient to find on Windows for me using Ctrl + F
